#Bave
Bave is a minimalistic calculation and file manipulation console.
This program is an experiment based on sources from the CalcWizard project and the Python programming language.
Clone the git repo into a directory of your choosing and navigate to the directory where the file "bave.py" is located.
After that, run: "python bave.py" from the terminal. The source files only work on Python 2.
